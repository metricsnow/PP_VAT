### **File Output Protocol**

**CRITICAL**: Only create analysis files (`.md` files) when explicitly requested by the user to save output as a file. Otherwise, provide all analysis directly in chat without creating files.

- **Default Behavior**: Provide analysis directly in chat
- **File Creation**: Only create `.md` analysis files when user explicitly asks to save as a file
- **Examples**:
  - ❌ "Analyze this codebase" → Provide analysis in chat
  - ❌ "Research this topic" → Provide research in chat  
  - ✅ "Create a file with this analysis" → Create `.md` file
  - ✅ "Save this analysis to a file" → Create `.md` file
- **When Creating Files**: Use descriptive lowercase filenames with proper suffixes (e.g., `analysis_analysis.md`, `summary_summary.md`)
