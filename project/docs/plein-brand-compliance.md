# Philipp Plein Brand Compliance - CRITICAL GUIDELINES

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** ✅ Active Requirements  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Do Not Violate

---

## Brand Color Palette - OFFICIAL POLICY

### ✅ APPROVED COLORS ONLY

**Primary Colors:**
- **Black:** `#000000` - Primary text, buttons, borders
- **White:** `#FFFFFF` - Background, inverted text

**Secondary Colors (Grays Only):**
- **Gray Light:** `#F8F8F8` - Light backgrounds
- **Gray:** `#E5E5E5` - Borders, dividers
- **Gray Medium:** `#999999` - Secondary text
- **Gray Dark:** `#666666` - Accent text

### ❌ FORBIDDEN COLORS - NEVER USE

The following colors are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** and violate Philipp Plein brand guidelines:

- ❌ **Gold** (`#D4AF37`, `#E8D9A7`, `#B8941D`) - **NOT brand colors**
- ❌ **Yellow** - No yellow variations allowed
- ❌ **Metallic colors** - No metallic gradients or effects
- ❌ **Other brand colors** - Only black, white, and grays

---

## Rationale

### Brand Analysis
Based on research of ple.in.com/de/home/ and Philipp Plein's official brand presence:

1. **Monochrome Philosophy:** Philipp Plein brand maintains a strict black/white/gray aesthetic
2. **Luxury Minimalism:** Clean, sophisticated, and uncluttered design language
3. **Brand Consistency:** No colorful accents that deviate from monochrome palette

### Why Gold Was Incorrect
- Gold (#D4AF37) was incorrectly added as a "luxury accent" color
- This color does NOT appear in Philipp Plein's official brand guidelines
- The brand's luxury is communicated through typography, spacing, and design, not color
- Adding gold violates the brand's minimalist monochrome philosophy

## Implementation History

### Issue Discovery (2025-01-27)
